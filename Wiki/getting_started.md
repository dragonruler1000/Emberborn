# Getting Started

Welcome to the mod! This page will guide you through the basics of progression — from your first ores to crafting powerful vials.

---

## Step 1: Gathering Ores

The first step is to mine **Tin Ore** and **Zinc Ore**.

* Smelt them in a furnace to get **[Tin Ingots](Items#tin-ingot)** and **[Zinc Ingots](Items#zinc-ingot)**.
* Both ores are common in the Overworld and essential for alloys.

See **[Recipes → Ingots](Recipes#ingots)** for details.

---

## Step 2: Crafting Alloys

Once you have Tin and Zinc, you can mix them with other metals to create alloys:

* **[Bronze](Items#bronze-ingot)** = Copper + Tin
* **[Pewter](Items#pewter-ingot)** = Tin + Copper
* **[Brass](Items#brass-ingot)** = Copper + Zinc
* **[Steel](Items#steel-ingot)** = Iron + Coal

These alloys are used in advanced crafting.

See **[Recipes → Alloy Crafting](Recipes#ingots)** for the full list.

## Step 3: Storage & Decoration

Once you have lots of ingots, you can compress them into block form.

* Every ingot type has a **block** (e.g., **[Brass Block](Blocks#brass-block)**, **[Steel Block](Blocks#steel-block)**).
* Blocks are great for decoration or compact storage.

See **[Recipes → Blocks](Recipes#blocks)**.

## Step 4: Brewing Vials

Vials are special items that grant potion-like effects.

* **[Brass Vial](Items#brass-vial)** → Strength & Resistance
* **[Tin Vial](Items#tin-vial)** → Night Vision

Each vial is crafted by combining an ingot with a potion.

See **[Recipes → Vials](Recipes#vials)**.

## Next Steps

* Experiment with alloys to discover which are most useful in your builds.
* Stockpile storage blocks for large-scale projects.
* Use vials strategically to give yourself an edge in combat or exploration.
